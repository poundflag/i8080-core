Code Style

Consistent code style is important for readability and maintainability of the project's codebase. Please follow these guidelines when writing code for [Project Name]:

    Indentation: Use a consistent indentation of 4 spaces for each level of indentation. Avoid using tabs for indentation.

    Braces: Place opening braces on the same line as the corresponding control statement or function declaration. Place closing braces on a new line, aligned with the opening statement.

    Line Length: Limit lines to a maximum of 80 characters. This helps maintain code readability across different environments and reduces the need for horizontal scrolling.

    Naming Conventions: Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, and types. Use camelCase for variable and function names, and PascalCase for type names. Avoid using single-letter variable names except for loop counters or other well-known conventions.

    Comments: Include helpful and explanatory comments to document the code's functionality, especially for complex logic or non-obvious decisions. Use inline comments sparingly and only when necessary.

    Whitespace: Use whitespace to improve code readability. Leave a single space after commas and operators. Add a blank line between logical sections of code to improve clarity.

    Error Handling: Properly handle errors and exceptions. Use appropriate error handling mechanisms like try-catch blocks or error codes as per the project's guidelines.

    Function Length: Keep functions concise and focused. Aim for shorter functions that perform a specific task. If a function becomes too long or complex, consider refactoring it into smaller, reusable functions.

    File Organization: Organize code files logically and keep them focused on a single responsibility. Use proper directory structure and modularization to separate concerns and improve maintainability.

    Version Control: Follow good practices when using version control systems like Git. Commit logical and atomic changes, write clear commit messages, and avoid committing code with syntax errors or debugging statements.

Remember, these guidelines are meant to enhance code consistency and readability across the project. Feel free to refer to existing code for examples and follow the existing style conventions.

By following these code style guidelines, we can maintain a clean and readable codebase that is easier to understand and maintain.
